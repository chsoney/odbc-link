ODBC-Link 1.0.5

Fixed a warning on Fedora 16:

odbclink.c: In function ‘query_common’:
odbclink.c:874:7: warning: variable ‘call_cntr’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Implemented odbclink.execute() for executing DML statements in
three variants, all returns void:

- odbclink.execute(conn int4, query text)
- odbclink.execute(dsn text, uid text, pwd text, query text)
- odbclink.execute(connstr text, query text)

Fixed reporting errors coming from remote servers in case of multiple
ODBC connections.

ODBC-Link 1.0.4

Added Changelog.
Fixed a nasty INT vs BIGINT problem on 64-bit big endian platforms.

ODBC-Link 1.0.3

Allow passing NUMERIC/DECIMAL values from ODBC into INT4/INT8/NUMERIC
and string-like types in PostgreSQL.
Extracting string-like values from ODBC has its own function now.
Don't depend on the value returned by SQLRowCount(), it's invalid
on at least Oracle resulting in empty resultset at the PostgreSQL side.

ODBC-Link 1.0.2

Limit LOGBINARY -> bytea conversion to PostgreSQL 8.5+ (actually, 9.0.0+)
Report more verbose error messages from ODBC.
One more size indicator problem fixed under 64-bit ODBC.

ODBC-Link 1.0.1

Fixed a problem with size indicators under 64-bit ODBC.
Fixed a compilation problem because of a typo (pree vs pfree).
